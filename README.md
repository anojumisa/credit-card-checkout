# Credit Card Checkout Design - Figma 100 Daily UI Challenge

This project tackles coding a credit card checkout design based on Figma's 100 Daily UI Challenge.

## Features:

-   Button hover effects: "Back" and "More" buttons change background color on hover.
-   Credit card section: Uses image layering with vectors and gradients to create the card. A 4x5 grid system separates sections. The background utilizes a gradient with a map vector layered on top (achieved with CSS).
-   Product image transition: Product image transitions to become wider when hovered over. This section uses a white background with a border radius applied only to the top section.

Feel free to explore and customize the code further.
Refer to the Figma design for a visual reference.
